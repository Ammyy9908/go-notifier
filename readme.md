# Notification Service

A scalable, multi-channel Notification Service that supports sending notifications through Email, SMS, and Web Push. The service is designed with prioritization, retry mechanisms, and fault tolerance to ensure reliable and timely message delivery. It adapts to user preferences, allowing personalized notifications across various channels.

---

## Features

- **Multi-Channel Support**: Send notifications via Email, SMS, or Web Push.
- **User Preferences**: Automatically selects the appropriate channel based on user preferences.
- **Prioritization**: High-priority notifications are processed first.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Failed notifications are retried with an exponential backoff.
- **Tracking and Logging**: Tracks notification status (sent, delivered, failed) and provides real-time monitoring.
- **Template Management**: Allows creation and management of templates with placeholders for personalized content.
